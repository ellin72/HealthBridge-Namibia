# Logo Assets (Alternative Location)

If you prefer to import the logo as a module instead of using the public folder, place your logo file here.

## Usage

If you place the logo here, update the import in the components:

```typescript
import logoPath from '../assets/images/healthbridge-logo.png';
```

## Recommended Location

For easier setup, we recommend placing the logo in the `public/` folder instead, as it's already configured that way.
